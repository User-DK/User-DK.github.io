### What did I do?
In Week 5, I enhanced the bindings' interface, created tests using pytest, and began working on Sphinx documentation for the project. I also considered adding CSV support to complement the existing text file support for networks and agent files. Week 6 was dedicated to further refining the bindings and documentation. I learned how to configure Sphinx, wrote CI for the docs, and started reading research papers on Opinion Dynamics to better understand the domain and improve the user guides. Additionally, I set up a blog with Jekyll to document my GSoC journey.

### Challenges?
Circular imports in the package naming convention gave me quite the headache, but with some help, I managed to resolve it. Another challenge was a nightmarish infinite loop bug in the ActivityDrivenModel bindings, which I’m still working to resolve.

### What’s next?
I plan to finish reading the research papers, complete the API design for the bindings, and continue polishing the documentation. There’s still much to do, but I’m excited to see it all come together.
