### What did I do?
In Week 9, I refactored the codebase, introduced a cleaner design for presenting models to the end-user, and removed unnecessary code. The remaining time has been spent writing examples, finalizing the documentation, and making the codebase as robust as possible.

By Week 11, I focused on visualization examples using Cytoscape, particularly for simulating the DeGroot model. This involved resolving test failures and preparing for the final documentation push. I also began working on the Python package wheel for PyPi distribution.

In the final Week 12, I continued refining the code by applying a more modular, OOP-based approach. I introduced inheritance to reduce code repetition, completed the remaining documentation, and worked on final tests and visualizations.

### Challenges?
A persistent test failure that seems to be an upstream issue in the Seldon codebase has been a notable challenge. Despite raising issues and working on solutions, this has been a tricky part of the final stretch.

### What’s next?
The last steps involve completing the final tests, polishing the documentation, and preparing the package for release. It’s been an incredible learning experience, and I’m excited to see the final product.

Thanks for following along on this journey!
